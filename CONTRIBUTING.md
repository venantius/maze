As you've probably noticed, this library is short on tests. As in, there are no tests. It turns out adding tests for random maze generation is tricky business and I had trouble thinking about how I would want that to work. If you've got an idea on how to test this thing, I'd love to hear it.

Outside of that, bugfixes, feature requests are welcome, but most generally I'd just encourage you to submit a PR up front. This isn't a particularly complicated library or repository, and I'll generally be following a fairly optimistic merge strategy.
